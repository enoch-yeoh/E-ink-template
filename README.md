# E-ink-template
A while back, I got my hands on an e-ink device.
It was originally supposed to be a name-tag, but there is customization available via micropython.
I uploaded my name as well as a black and white pixel of my face as a namebadge.

It requires some additional software like GIMP and THONNY.
